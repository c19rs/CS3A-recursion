You must track each completed function and test data in your repository to receive full credit.  See the section below on tracking.

We will test your methods thoroughly, and you will not receive points for methods which fail.

We will add 70 to your score as a curve.  The maximum score will be 95.

You may resubmit this assignment without penalty until 10/30 at 9pm.

## Tracking
When you are done working on a function (you have written and tested it), you should commit that code to your git repository.  To do this, add the appropriate files to the tracking area, that then write a commit message
```
git commit -m "wrote and tested code for #N1"
```
Your message MUST include the appropriate # code, which can be found in the documentation next to every function.  You may commit multiple times on the same # code, we will look at the last one.
