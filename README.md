## Tracking
When you are done working on a function it is a good idea to save a checkpoint in your git repository.  To do this, enter

git commit -a -m "a short message about your progress"
```
Often that message is about the contents you have just added, for instance "completed fibonacci function" or "added tests for reverse"
